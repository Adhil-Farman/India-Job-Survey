## Overview

The **India Job Survey** aims to compare and contrast various aspects of government and private sector jobs in India. The analysis focuses on the following:

- Employment sectors (Government vs. Private)
- Impact of educational qualifications (Degree vs. No Degree)
- Expected yearly income across technical, non-technical, and arts backgrounds
- Preferred number of ideal workdays

---

## Dataset

The dataset, `JobSurveyIndia.csv`, contains anonymized survey responses regarding job preferences, income expectations, and workday preferences.

---

## Visualization

A detailed Tableau visualization has been created using the dataset. The primary chart showcases the **ideal number of workdays** categorized by:

1. Employment Sector (Government vs. Private)
2. Educational Degree (Yes vs. No)
3. Employment Background (Technical, Non-Technical, Arts)
4. Yearly Income Range

2. **Workdays:**
   - Government sector jobs tend to align with a higher ideal number of workdays, especially for those without degrees.
   - Private sector employees, particularly in the non-technical field, exhibit a balanced preference across different income brackets.

3. **Educational Impact:**
   - Degree holders show a clear preference for higher income brackets, especially in technical jobs.
